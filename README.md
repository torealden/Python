# Python

# Hello World!

# Old man just learning to code but interested in using python to develop quantative financial models.
# Particularly interested in commodity markets and commodity spreads and keen to know what has already been done in this space
# so I don't waste time reinventing the wheel. I know the trading community is not particularly eager to share this kind of stuff
# so I expect I will reinvent a really shitty wheel or two or three.
